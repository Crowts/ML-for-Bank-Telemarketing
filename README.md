# ML-for-Bank-Telemarketing
Application of multiple ML algorithms for optimising bank telemarketing projects. 

Telemarketing campaigns are expensive endeavours requiring a large amount of human and financial resources. Deciding which customers to target is important as this optimises the campaign and increases the chances of a successful sale. Many marketing and financial institutions have a keen interest in optimising their marketing campaigns. The [bank telemarketing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016792361400061X) is well studied and has also been posed as a competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/launchds-classification). The data used here is the bank additional dataset (bank-additional.csv)

I conducted a simple investigation of the problem and implemented six different ML algorithms to predict successful telemarking sales. The jupyter notebook bank_marketing_data.ipynb has all six trained models. Individual model implementations are also included in other notebooks. 

More indepth implemetations can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/launchds-classification).
